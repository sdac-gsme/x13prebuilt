## Windows binaries

The Windows binaries are the ones from the US Census
[Website](http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_pc.html).

Downloading from this repository, rather than from the Census Website, ensures
the link still works after a version update, which usually results in a new
filename.
